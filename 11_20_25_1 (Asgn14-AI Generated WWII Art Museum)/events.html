        <h1>Upcoming Events</h1>

        <p>
            The WWII Aircraft Artist Museum hosts a variety of special events throughout the year,
            offering visitors the opportunity to connect more deeply with aviation history and the 
            artists who bring it to life. From expert-led lectures to hands-on workshops, our events 
            are designed to enrich the museum experience for guests of all ages.
        </p>

        <p>
            Monthly artist demonstrations give visitors a chance to watch illustrators and painters 
            recreate WWII aircraft scenes using both traditional and modern techniques. These sessions 
            include Q&A opportunities and are perfect for aspiring artists or anyone curious about how 
            aviation artwork is created.
        </p>

        <p>
            The museum also hosts historical presentations with guest speakers, including historians, 
            veterans, and restoration specialists. These talks dive into the stories behind the aircraft, 
            the missions they flew, and the personal experiences of those who served. Seating is limited, 
            so early arrival is recommended for these popular programs.
        </p>

        <p>
            Families can enjoy our weekend “Aviation Discovery Days,” which feature interactive stations, 
            scavenger hunts, and kid-friendly art activities. Seasonal events such as the “Wings & Winter 
            Gala” and the annual “History in the Sky Festival” bring together community members for live 
            music, guided tours, themed exhibits, and special one-day-only displays.
        </p>

        <p>
            Whether you're an aviation enthusiast, a student, or simply looking for a memorable day out,
