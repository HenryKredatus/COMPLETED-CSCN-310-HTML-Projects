  <h2>History</h2>
  <p>Founded in <strong>1974</strong>, <em>Markenson Industrials</em> began as a small, family-operated fabrication workshop in <strong>Samson, Arizona</strong>, serving local agricultural and construction businesses. Over the decades, the company evolved from a regional metalworks supplier into a full-scale industrial solutions provider, offering precision manufacturing, automation integration, and logistics coordination for clients nationwide.</p>

  <p>In the <strong>1980s</strong>, Markenson expanded into custom machinery design, building its first proprietary assembly systems that improved output and reduced maintenance costs for heavy equipment manufacturers. By the <strong>1990s</strong>, continued investment in automation and CNC technologies allowed the company to handle larger contracts and meet strict international production standards.</p>

  <p>The <strong>early 2000s</strong> marked a turning point, as Markenson Industrials partnered with energy and transportation companies to develop more efficient components and systems aimed at reducing environmental impact. This era also saw the construction of a new <strong>85,000-square-foot headquarters and production facility</strong> in Samson, designed for both innovation and sustainability.</p>

  <p>Today, Markenson Industrials stands as a trusted name in American manufacturing — combining over <strong>five decades of experience</strong> with a commitment to modernization, employee development, and environmental responsibility. The company continues to expand its research initiatives, focusing on <strong>automation, materials science, and green manufacturing</strong> to meet the challenges of the next generation of industry.</p>
