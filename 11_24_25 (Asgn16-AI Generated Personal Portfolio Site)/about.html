                   My name is Henry Kredatus, a Liberty University computer science major. I am an aspiring programmer, YouTuber, and writer looking to discover myself and sharpen my skills in my career field, all while bolstering my resume. I'm currently honing my skills in C++ and HTML.

                    2013 is the year I began to realize my passions, as that was the year I first started tinkering with Scratch and the video editor Sony Vegas. Back then, it was all fun and games, but over time, I came to realize my love and talent for those activities had the potential to materialize into a career path in the future. I have come a long way since then - having explored new programming languages, grown as a writer, done hundreds of hours of community service, created one of the top 1,000 most-followed accounts on Scratch, graduated high school, started majoring in web and mobile programming in college, and launched a budding YouTube channel. But despite all my experiences and inclinations, I have never attempted to take them to the next level - the professional one - until now.

                    I have a decade of dabbling in various programming languages under my belt (with varying levels of proficiency), including Java, HTML+CSS, Python, Scratch, and C++. I'm currently on the verge of finishing my second of three C++ courses as well as my first HTML course. The latter involved the development of a portfolio of 16 different webpages, with this being the final one. My fate is cloudy, but my future is bright, and I eagerly await opportunities that can help me grow all the more, and eventually graduate and find a long-term career.
