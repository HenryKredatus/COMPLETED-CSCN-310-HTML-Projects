    <h1>About Us</h1>

    <h2>Our History</h2>
    <p>
        Gordon Insurance Associates was founded over three decades ago with a simple mission: 
        to provide dependable insurance solutions and personal service to families and businesses 
        throughout Orangeburg and the surrounding communities. What began as a small, local agency 
        has grown into a trusted name in the region, known for its commitment to honesty, reliability, 
        and strong client relationships.
    </p>

    <p>
        From our early days offering basic home and auto insurance, we have expanded our services 
        to include comprehensive personal, business, and industry-specific policies. As new risks 
        and challenges have emerged, our agency has adapted to meet the changing needs of our clients— 
        always with the same dedication to protection and peace of mind.
    </p>

    <p>
        Today, Gordon Insurance Associates continues to uphold the values we were built on: 
        community support, clear communication, and individualized coverage solutions. Our team 
        works one-on-one with each client to ensure they receive the attention and understanding 
        they deserve, just as we have done since the very beginning.
